                    <strong>Art history?</strong>
                </h1>
                <blockquote>
                    Prior to data science, I was a <strong>professional art historian and specialist</strong>. (See <a href="../profile/previous-experience.html">here</a> for details.)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A common theme across every experience was the importance of communicating abstract concepts to a non-technical audience.
                    This was especially challenging when I was at Christie's, as this communication often involved tens of millions of dollars of fine art.
                    For example, when given a Picasso, I had to research that masterpiece well enough to not only predict its opening price, but also
                    recommend growth strategies to stakeholders in order to maximize their piece's closing price. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In many ways, my art experience was heavily multidisciplinary, as it drew upon both the analytical framework for pricing and the creative, 
                    open-ended domain of art history. My job was to put a numerical value on the inherently non-numerical, which taught me many
                    data research methodologies that I continue to use to this day.

                <h1>
                    <strong>Why did you leave?</strong>
                </h1>
                <blockquote>
                    While the art market was exciting, I gradually realized a significant drawback: its evaluation process was heavily manual--slow and biased.
                    Seeking a more effective approach, I volunteered to explore new tools that could enhance the industry process--an initiative that ultimately
                    led me to discover machine learning for the first time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I was instantly fascinated by the technology and quickly recognized that if I continued in the art market, I wouldn't have the opportunity to fully develop
                    my technical skills. After graduating from Penn, I made the decision to turn down a return offer to Christie's and instead embarked on a
                    journey of self-teaching in math, computer science, and data science.
                </blockquote>

                    <strong>What happened after?</strong>
                </h1>
                <blockquote>
                    Since graduating, I have been deeply committed to self-educating in this domain. I pursued self-paced programs like freeCodeCamp, studied math 
                    and computer science through free PDF textbooks, and dedicated myself to numerous <a href="https://github.com/cdenq/my-directory">passion projects</a> 
                    to bridge the gap between theory and practice. While I had to work fulltime to finance this transition, I was ultimately very fortunate to
                    have landed some tutoring and collegiate assistant positions, which helped me maximize the time I spent immersed in data upskilling.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Fast forward to today, I am extremely lucky to have had the opportunities I've had to leverage my data science skills towards making impact! To see examples
                    of my experiences, please refer to <a href="../profile/data-science.html">industry impact</a> and <a href="../profile/ai-research.html">academia impact</a>.

                    <strong>Math courses while working?</strong>
                </h1>
                <blockquote>
                    While I was able to self-study math well enough to land positions in the field, having a formal degree in mathematics has always been a personal goal of mine. Coming from
                    a non-STEM background, math just wasn't emphasized in art history, and I didn't want that to be the reason holding me back from progressing further in data science. Thus,
                    I decided to enroll in official university courses alongside my work and research as means of formally building that "traditional" quantitative foundation that normal CS majors have.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With much happiness, I'm proud say that I've almost completed an accredited-equivalency to a bachelors in mathematics! Coursework I have left to take...

                    <strong>AI safety and data science?</strong>
                </h1>
                <blockquote>
                    While transitioning in data science, I was eager to gain any and all experience. As a result, I rode this momentum into deeper data roles in business intelligence but 
                    also in AI research. Through this exposure to academia, I unexpectedly ended up deeply appreciating the user safety aspects of my data products--a feeling that ultimately
                    drove me to pursue dual-careers into both industry (data science) and academia (AI safety/research).
                    <br>

                    I see this maximizing the net world impact I have through my domain!
