                      I'm super excited about this Spotify opportunity! I believe I am a great fit because:

                          (1) I am passionate about helping others solve their problems!
                        </strong>
                      </h4>
                      As an ex-art-curator, I have always utilized organization and story-telling skills in order to solve problems. Back then, I was challenged daily to properly communicate art insights to a non-technical (non-artistic) audience through my gallery arrangements. This fundamental passion for deeply understanding the user (art viewer) spills over everything I do.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Beyond just the parallel industry experience from which I can draw upon or the extensive history in honing my communication and user-centered design, I am also deeply committed to helping others make better sense of the world around them. Whether it's understanding art or programming apps, I am value-aligned with Spotify's own mission of helping others!
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
                        <strong>
                          (2) I'm passionate about music!
                        </strong>
                      </h4>
                      Speaking of Spotify, there is no one that connects people to music better than Spotify. As a first-generation Taiwanese-American who was born in Los Angeles, I have always lived at the intersection of many cultures. Growing up, it was a near-daily occurrence to be listening to hip hop at school and classical Taiwanese opera at home. Music was that universal translator that helped me bridge my Taiwanese heritage with my contemporary American home, and Spotify was the means that helped me do so. I love music because it gives me a window into the rich diversity of our world's cultures, and I love Spotify because it connects me with that music. I want to join the Spotify team because I want other kids to grow up with the musical experiences I had while growing up!
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
                        <strong>
                          (3) I'm passionate about technology!
                        </strong>
                      </h4>
                      I am fascinated by the power of code. As an avid self-learner and serial project builder, I have eagerly taught myself how to program because I believe software engineering is critical to our shared mission of connecting the world to its musical diversity. I pursue software because it automates the busy work (freeing up our time to focus on what's important) and scales the impact (accurately and quickly leveraging user data to connect others) of any project at hand; I pursue software because it helps me help others solve their problems!
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
                        <strong>
                          (4) I have the necessary unique perspective!
                        </strong>
                      </h4>
                      Given Spotify's mission of unlocking the world's creativity, Spotify needs an equally global team of thinkers and engineers to best reach its many audiences. Given my unique intersectionalities, I believe I bring an underrepresented perspective to the tech space that would greatly benefit Spotify's ability to understand, connect, and share music creativity. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      As mentioned above, I bring in a parallel range of industry experiences from my art curator background. This non-traditional STEM background teaches me the values of clear communication and user-centered focus, while also expanding my exposure to the wide spectrum of client types and perspectives.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Likewise, my heritage as a Taiwanese (NOT mainland Chinese) brings a valuable perspective to the music and tech industry. For example, Taiwan is known for its unique combination of progressive values (first Asian country to legalize gay marriage and to have a female president) and deep respect for tradition (musical culture pays homage to indigenous Hokkien and Hakka people). Combined with my American upbringing, I believe I can better understand and relate to a cross-section of ethnicities that are typically invisible in tech.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      And lastly, as a gender nonconforming and pansexual individual, I believe my perspective as a member of the LGBTQ+ community is also underrepresented in tech. To give an example from my art curator days, figure drawing is often taught using a male model as the “base case” and any female or non-binary linework is seen as supplementary training. This results in traditional portraiture being unable to properly communicate female and non-binary dynamism in their work, as the overall American culture is predominantly literate in only masculine forms. This kind of identity politics was at the forefront of my mind when I was curating art shows, and I seek to bring the same level of consideration for equality and visibility into the software products I would design.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Ultimately, I have always been impressed with Spotify's commitment to positive work culture and DEI values. Given the intersectionalities of my profiles: non-traditional STEM, underrepresented Taiwanese, and member of LGBTQ+ community, I'm eager to work with a company that not only harnesses but also celebrates its employees' diverse experiences.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
                        <strong>
                          (5) I have the necessary soft skills!
                        </strong>
                      </h4>
                      And finally, my last reason for why I am a good fit is because of my soft skills. While I did not start with a traditional CS background, I have been fanatically self-teaching myself code through freeCodeCamp and developing a quantitative intuition through my mathematics degree. Going beyond just the theory, I love to create personal projects on GitHub to cement my software development skills. While I have been working full-time on the side to support my tuition and SWE aspirations, I have been very lucky to get a junior developer position with Tzu Chi and multiple tutoring positions in math, allowing me to fully immerse myself in upskilling. As a career transitioner, this demonstrates my curiosity, grit, and resilience when it comes to self-teaching software development.

                        <strong>
                          In conclusion...
                        </strong>
                      </h4>
                      I believe that I am a great fit for Spotify's fellowship program because I am exactly the type of early career talent that Spotify is looking for! I resonate strongly with Spotify's mission (music, tech, and vision), have an underrepresented perspective in tech, and possess the engineering passion, initiative, and grit to be able to thrive in this kind of accelerated program!

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
                      While the mission of connecting users with their favorite music is great, it's all for naught if there are not proper security measures in place. In our current digitalized world of mash-ups, remixes, and now generative-audio-AI, I think an often overlooked feature of music is its security. Thus, in a perfect world, I would like to build an audio-deepfake detector that can pinpoint the origin of certain sounds, which ultimately helps pinpoint whether a song is “faked”. Specifically within the context of generative AI borrowing voices from other creators or sampling sounds without permission, malicious users could benefit from the creativity and talent of others. This not only disrupts the integrity of the system, but it also undermines the trust our listeners would have in the identities of their Spotify songs. Thus, I think it would be a really fascinating project to be able to create a back-end audio-deepfake detector.

                      </h4>
                      For my most recent full-stack software development project, I worked with a team to deploy a deepfake image detector model to a streamlined app. Here, the importance of aligning on milestones and expectations, hand-off formats (so people working downstream can easily pick up where you left off), and meeting times were critical to this project's success. Because of our communication and teamwork, we were able to create this project in just 10 days.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Likewise, when I was a tutor lead for mathematics at Foothill College, I needed to work with a team of not only other math tutors, but also the tutorees themselves to ensure that we were on the same page. Because every student at Foothill Community College has different needs, I was also constantly asking for feedback on how I can best adapt/tailor my teaching style to the individual student. I believe iterating on feedback is another form of teamwork that is critical for important projects!

                          (2) I am comfortable tackling ambiguity and learning from it!
                        </strong>
                      </h4>
                      In the workplace, I have dealt with ambiguity for freelance software projects. For example, one client was interested in “measuring his in-game performance” for a specific video game but was unsure about what that entailed. Tackling ambiguity, I brainstormed with the client to figure out that he wanted a history of performance metrics to show his rate of improvement, and then I researched different ways of attaining that information. I discovered that the video game had an API and then learned how to use it from the documentation. I also came up with metrics that would be important for the client's goal, effectively helping him problem-solve his challenge!
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Another example is my learning journey. Having self-taught programming from freeCodeCamp for over a year now, I am extremely comfortable with initiating and directing my own learning. I am also resilient when it comes to troubleshooting/debugging, as often I will need to find additional resources to bolster my understanding of a SWE concept. In fact, this is why I am so eager for Spotify: I am ready to transition away from self-help guides and passion projects into tackling real-world challenges with experienced mentors at Spotify!
